Important:
    - Port to Godot 4.1 even if still no out

Missing:
    - Jump sound
    - Esc button for pause
    - Auto Focus on start button, so you can start the game with space
    - A Game Over screen

Improvements:
    - Stronger wind
    - Better player sprite
    - Fog on higher levels (?) or fire smoke at lower levels
    - Better parallax on background (precisely last layer should go up instead of down (?)

    - new levels
